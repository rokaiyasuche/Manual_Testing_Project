# Manual_Testing_Foodpanda
## Project Overview
Foodpanda is an online food delivery platform that connects users with restaurants, providing a seamless and efficient ordering experience. This project involved manual testing to ensure the platform’s functionality, security, usability, and compatibility across different environments.

## Scope of Testing Approach
1. Functional Testing: To ensure each feature
2. UI Testing: To check the application's user interface for consistency, responsiveness, and
ease of navigation.
3. Performance Testing: To test the app under various load conditions, including high-traffic
scenarios.
4. Security Testing: To validate secure payment gateways, user data protection, and resistance
to vulnerabilities like SQL injections or unauthorized access.
5. Compatibility Testing: To verify the app works smoothly across multiple devices, screen
sizes, and operating systems.
6. Regression Testing: To ensure that changes or updates do not affect existing functionalities.
7. Global Components Testing: To confirm localization and adaptability to different
languages and currencies.
8. Usability Testing: To evaluate the user-friendliness and intuitiveness of the application.
9. Integration Testing: To check the smooth interaction between different modules
10. Database Testing: To ensure accurate storage, retrieval, and security of data.
